<label>Émilie du Châtelet with her translation and commentary on Isaac Newton's <em>Principia Mathematica</em></label>

<blockquote cite="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Chatelet.html">I feel the full weight of the prejudice which so universally excludes us from the sciences; it is one of the contradictions in life that has always amazed me, seeing that the law allows us to determine the fate of great nations, but that there is no place where we are trained to think ... Let the reader ponder why, at no time in the course of so many centuries, a good tragedy, a good poem, a respected tale, a fine painting, a good book on physics has ever been produced by a woman. Why these creatures whose understanding appears in every way similar to that of men, seem to be stopped by some irresistible force, but until they do, women will have reason to protest against their education. ... I am convinced that many women are either unaware of their talents by reason of the fault in their education or that they bury them on account of prejudice for want of intellectual courage. My own experience confirms this. Chance made me acquainted with men of letters who extended the hand of friendship to me. ... I then began to believe that I was a being with a mind ...<cite><br><br>

<p>Gabrielle Émilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, Marquise Du Châtelet--known as Émilie du Châtelet--was an eighteenth-century French writer and thinker who contributed to mathematics, physics, and philosophy. She was widely respected among peers at the time for her contributions to science and philosophy, and her ideas were profoundly influential, being cited numerous times in the high-profile Enlightenment project of the <em>Encyclopédie</em> edited by Diderto and d'Alembert.
</p>

<p> She began learning astronomy at the age of ten, and by the time she was twelve was fluent in Latin, Italian, Greek, and German, as well as her native French. She brought this linguistic knowledge to bear on her later work as a translator, while also adding significant knowledge or perspectives to the works she translated. She married and had three children with her husband, while also living and collaborating with the famous writer Voltaire. A later affair resulted in the birth of a fourth child, and in her own death as a result of childbirth.
